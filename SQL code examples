#How this can answer business problems or help a business out.
Example I used SQL to find which homes sold for over 400,000 and had over 4 beds. This could help a real 
estate company find homes that are selling well and have a high amount of beds so they can charge more.

#Next I utlized SQL to find the prices of newer homes (2010-present)
This helps a company better understand what the market is for new homes in Nashville. So they know what to expect when purchasing newer homes in the area

#I then was able to look for sale prices based on the Full baths and the acreage. This helps a company better understand what to 
expect in terms of sales based on metrics such as Full baths or acreage. For example homes with 2 full baths and 1 half bath, had an average sale price of $232,841.

# Furthermore I created SQL queries to find homes that underperformed. Where Homes that sold below total value where considered poor. 
Whereas homes that sold for over total value, where labeled as excellent. This gives a business a good idea of the homes that are selling for higher than the projections.
Perhaps homes in these areas in the future will follow the same trend and they now know where extacly to look for when looking for homes that sell above projections.

#Finally, I presented the difference between what is the total value of the home vs the selling price of the home. That difference was +23,000. 
Meaning the average difference between the selling price and the total value was over $23,000. 
Therfore, when we want to sell a home, we can expect a markup in the selling price to be above $23,000 the 
total value of the home. This means now a a business can price better their homes and maximize profit.
