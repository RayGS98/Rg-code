# Load the necessary library
library(forecast)

# Create a sample time series data
# You can replace this with your own dataset
# In this example, we'll use the 'AirPassengers' dataset that comes with R
data("AirPassengers")

# Convert the data to a time series object
ts_data <- ts(AirPassengers, frequency = 12)

# Determine the index for splitting the data
split_index <- length(ts_data) - 12  # Assuming you want to use the last 12 months as test data

# Split the data into training and test sets
train_data <- window(ts_data, start = 1, end = split_index)
test_data <- window(ts_data, start = split_index + 1)

# Fit a forecasting model (e.g., Exponential Smoothing)
forecast_model <- ets(train_data)

# Generate forecasts for future time periods
forecast_values <- forecast(forecast_model, h = 12)  # Forecast for the next 12 months

# Print the forecasted values
print(forecast_values)

# Plot the forecast
plot(forecast_values)



New example

# Create a time series object
financial_ts <- ts(my_data, frequency = 12) # Adjust frequency as needed

# Automatically select an ARIMA model
arima_model <- auto.arima(financial_ts)

# Generate forecasts
forecasts <- forecast(arima_model, h = n)  # n is the number of periods to foreca
